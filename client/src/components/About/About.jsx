        Yangu properties (K) Ltd is actively involved in property development,
        to meet ever increasing need for housing in Kenya. The Kenya real estate
        boom has arisen because many investors have switched their savings from
        the low-yield treasury bills to the hugely profitable property market.
        This has been complemented by banks introducing and aggressively
        marketing various mortgage products. The comparatively low Kenya
        property prices are indicative of a strong capital growth potential and
        reasonable rental yields. The latter is attributable to the fact that
        currently, Kenya’s annual housing demand stands at 150,000 yet supply is
        only 25,000 units, resulting in a shortage of 125,000 units. With this
        great need for housing, Keja Yangu properties (k) Ltd has a prime
        objective in the development of new housing projects and partnering with
        other developers who share in this vision. We have credible experience
        in property development, marketing, sale and management not only in
        Kenya, but also internationally, with a combined experience Professional
        Services.
